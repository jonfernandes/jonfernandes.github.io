    <h1>How do I claim points on the Eurostar Plus Points programme?</h1>
    <div>I forgot to quote my Eurostar Plus Points membership number when booking. Can I still claim the points?
Eurostar Plus Points can only be credited at the time of booking by quoting a valid membership number and as such cannot be added retrospectively.

If I book a journey whilst logged into my Eurostar Plus Points account, will the points be credited automatically?
Membership details and any registered preferences will be stored in the system however you will still need to select your name from the drop down to add your membership number. For friends and family travellers who are not members of the Eurostar Plus Points scheme, you will need to manually enter your membership number for each traveller. (Please note that if you do not add the number at the time of booking it is not posible to go back and add it afterwards)

Are there a maximum number of points that I can claim as a Eurostar Plus Points member?
Eurostar Plus Points members can earn a maximum of 1500 points per quarter with a maximum of 750 points per quarter coming from friends and family. Any travel made in addition to this will not accrue points.

How can I check whether my past travel has been credited to my account?
Logging onto your online account and looking at the statement page will verify journeys credited to your Eurostar Plus Points account.

Can I transfer points from a Eurostar Plus Points account to a Eurostar Frequent Traveller account?
Since Eurostar Frequent Traveller and Eurostar Plus Points are two independent schemes, points cannot be transferred between them.

Can I upgrade tickets I&#39;ve already purchased using my Eurostar Plus points?
No, you won&#39;t be able to use your accrued Eurostar Plus points to upgrade or change existing reservations.

I&#39;ve booked a journey using an incorrect membership number. Can I reclaim these points?
No, the Eurostar Plus Points membership number needs to be correctly entered at the time of booking as points cannot be claimed retrospectively.</div>
