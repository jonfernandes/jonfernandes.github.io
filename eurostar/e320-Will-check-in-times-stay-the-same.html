    <h1>e320 - Will check-in times stay the same?</h1>
    <div>Yes, they’ll stay the same. Although the e320 can carry more travellers, it also has four more boarding doors and it’s wider, making it generally more accessible. <br><br>The Business Premier 10 minute check-in will stay too, but we’ll need to proactively encourage people to board as they may have further to walk. They can also board at the nearest door and walk down the train.<br><br>We also plan to introduce boarding from the upper level of the Business Premier lounge at St Pancras.</div>
