    <h1>Will my Eurostar Frequent Traveller points or account ever expire?</h1>

On 30 September 2016, we’ll be updating our system and all unused points over three years old will expire.<br><br><b>Can I see in my online account how many points are due to expire?</b><br>Unfortunately not, but if you have any questions about your points, just <a href="https://help.eurostar.com/email#/" target="_blank">get in touch</a>  with our dedicated Eurostar™ Frequent Traveller team.<br><br><b>Can you top up my points so I have enough to claim a reward?</b><br>Unfortunately we can’t give you any extra points unless you buy and travel on a Eurostar ticket, or earn points through our partners. <a href="http://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/loyalty-programmes/eurostar-frequent-traveller/earn-points" target="_blank">Find out more &gt; </a><br><br><b>If I redeem my points on a gift, when will it be delivered?</b><br>Since we’re receiving so many orders at the moment, it may take up to 28 days to receive your gift. <br><br><b>I’ve lost the email you sent telling me how many points are due to expire.

Can you extend the expiry deadline?</b><br>You’ve got until 30 September to decide, so there’s no rush. Don’t forget, you can book up to six months ahead for most routes, subject to availability, and tickets booked using your Eurostar™ Frequent Traveller points can be exchanged once before departure (exchanges are unlimited for Eurostar™ carte blanche holders), so you can always change your plans nearer the time. <a href="https://help.eurostar.com/faq/uk-en/question/How-far-in-advance-can-I-book-Eurostar-tickets" target="_blank">Check when to book &gt;</a> <br><br><b>The number of points you’ve said will expire is incorrect.
