    <h1>Can I take Christmas crackers on board the Eurostar?</h1>
    <div>Yes, you can take Christmas crackers on board the Eurostar in sensible amounts, whether in boxes or individually; the amount of explosive material is insignificant (if any large amount were present, we would detect it in our normal screening). 

However, we would advise that you carry the crackers in your luggage and would request that you do not pull the crackers on board, to avoid annoyance or alarm to fellow travellers.</div>
