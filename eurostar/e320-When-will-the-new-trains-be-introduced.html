    <h1>e320 - When will the new trains be introduced?</h1>
    <div>The first e300 started running in August and the next is due in May 2016, with more e300s being worked on and rolled out by March 2018. <br><br>We’ll start introducing our new e320s from 20 November 2015 on the London-Paris route. We’ll initially have one commercial e320 running, then ramp up to four for the Christmas and New Year period. <br><br>From Jan 2016, 50% of Paris trains will be e320s. This means that our travellers will have a 50% chance of taking an e320 between Paris and London, and 80% by Easter 2016. <br><br>By the end of 2016, the Paris-London route will be 100% e320. <br><br>In 2017 we’ll start running e320s on our Brussels route, with 30% by Q3 and 80% by Q4 that year. The Amsterdam route is also planned to start in 2017. <br><br>By March 2018 all Eurostar journeys will be on e300s and e320s.</div>
