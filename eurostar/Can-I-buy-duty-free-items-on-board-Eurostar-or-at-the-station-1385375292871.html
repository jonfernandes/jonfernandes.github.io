    <h1>Can I buy duty free items on board Eurostar or at the station?</h1>
    <div>Duty free goods can only be purchased when travelling outside of Europe. 

You can purchase duty paid goods from some shops once you arrive at your destination but Eurostar do not sell duty free or duty paid goods either at the terminals or onboard.</div>
