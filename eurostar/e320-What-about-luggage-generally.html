    <h1>e320 - What about luggage generally?</h1>
    <div>While designing our new trains, we made sure we could keep our competitive advantage over airlines, with their strict size and weight restrictions, without compromising other features. <br><br>For the majority, the basic luggage allowance of two 85cm items plus a small piece of hand luggage per person has not changed. However, if you are travelling with a Business Premier ticket, you will now be entitled to take 3 pieces of luggage with you. <br><br>Although the e320 interiors have a more spacious feel, there isn’t enough space per person to accommodate additional luggage, so we’ll be keeping our current luggage allowance.</div>
