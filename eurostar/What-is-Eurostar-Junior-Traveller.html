We can only take children and teens aged 8 to 15. </span><br><br><b><span style="color: black;">Are tickets refundable or exchangeable?</span></b><br><span style="color: black;">Junior Traveller tickets are non-exchangeable and non-refundable. </span><br><br><b>My child would like to take more luggage than he or she can carry. Is there a porter service?</b><br><span style="color: black;">Unfortunately there isn’t, so please make sure your child can carry their own bags.</span><br> <br><span style="color: black;">They can bring two bags (up to 85cm), up to 10kg, and one small piece of hand luggage. </span><br><br><b><span style="color: black;">How qualified are the Junior </span>Traveller chaperones <span style="color: black;">who’ll travel with my child?</span></b><br><span style="color: black;">All our Junior Traveller </span>chaperones <span style="color: black;">hold a </span>BAFA qualification and <span style="color: black;">have passed the appropriate safety checks required for working with children. </span><br><br><b><span style="color: black;">Will my child be looked after throughout the journey?</span></b><br><span style="color: black;">Yes, one of our dedicated Junior Traveller </span>chaperones <span style="color: black;">will look after your child every step of the way. When they arrive at their destination, they’ll stay with your child until they’re collected.</span><br><br><b>What if my child loses his or her passport during the journey?</b><br>The Junior Traveller pack contains a small pouch for their passport, which your child can wear around their neck.<br><br><b><span style="color: black;">What if the nominated adult is unable to collect my child at Arrivals?</span></b><br><span style="color: black;">It’s essential that the nominated person can collect your child at Arrivals. If they can’t make it for any reason, we’ll call you and liaise with local authorities, but this will cause a considerable delay.</span><br> <br><b><span style="color: black;">Can you give my child their medicine?</span></b><br><span style="color: black;">For safety reasons, unfortunately not.<br><br><b>What if I need to contact my child?</b><br>You&#39;ll be given a hotline number to use if you need to. If your child&#39;s journey is delayed, we&#39;ll send you a text message or give you a call.</span><br><br><b>Do I need to pack a picnic for my child?</b><br>Although the journey takes less than two and a half hours, we recommend packing them a snack and drink for the journey, just in case they get peckish or the train’s running late. They won’t be able to pick anything up in the departure lounge or on board.<br><br><b>Will there be activities on board? </b><br>We’ll provide activities to keep them amused en route, but they’re welcome to bring their own books, magazines or games.<br><br><b>What if my child needs to go to the loo during the journey?</b><br><span style="color: black;">Although the chaperone won’t be able to take them to the loo, the group will be sitting nearby. So, they’ll be able to keep an eye on them when they go. </span><br><br><b>What time should we arrive at the station?</b><br><span style="color: black;">Please arrive at the station 90 minutes before departure. The group will go through the ticket gates 45-60 minutes before departure. If you arrive less than 45 minutes before departure, your child won’t be able to travel. </span><br> <br><span style="color: black;">You’ll find our Junior Traveller team at the dedicated meeting point, next to the Business Premier ticket office in London and just past the ticket office in Paris. </span><br> <br><span style="color: black;">You’ll have to stay at the station until the train leaves, just in case it’s running late or it’s cancelled.</span><br> <br><span style="color: black;">Whoever’s collecting your child will need to be at Arrivals at least 15 minutes before the train is due and bring their photo ID with them. If there are any problems, please call the hotline number you’re given as soon as possible.</span></span></span></p></div>
