    <div><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12px;">Initial testing of the wifi system has gone well.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12px;">The final stage of testing will happen on board and on route over the next few weeks.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12px;">The signal varies depending on where the train is and how many customers are using it, hence the need to wait until we were able to operate the train to complete the final stages. </span></li></ul></div>
