    <h1>I keep getting a message saying there are no trains available.</h1>
    <div>When searching for train availability for the dates you wish to travel the following tips may help.

Try entering your time of travel as 6am or 7am for both your outward and return journey. This will give you plenty of time to make any journey connections and ensure you are able to complete a long journey on the same day. You will be able to search earlier or later train times on the next page by clicking on the appropriate button at the bottom of the page.

Weekends and bank holidays can be busy so you may need to consider travelling on early morning trains or off peak trains in order to obtain the best results.

Try alternative dates, maybe travel the evening before or the morning after.

Try to make your booking as far in advance of travel as possible

Please note: 
Eurostar train only bookings can be booked a maximum of 120 days in advance of your return date of travel.

Journeys that include a TGV connection to a town or city within France can be booked a maximum of 90 days in advance of your return date of travel.

Journeys that involve connecting trains from your home town or city in the UK can be booked 84 days in advance of your return date of travel. (This can vary depending on the train operating company and any planned engineering works)
Please also note:
Booking single journeys that originate from French cities other than Paris to the UK is not possible on the UK version of our web site. In order to make this type of booking you would need to book on the French version of our web site.</div>
