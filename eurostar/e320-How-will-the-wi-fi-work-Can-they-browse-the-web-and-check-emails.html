    <h1>e320 - How will the wi-fi work? Can they browse the web and check emails?</h1>
    <div>We know how much our customers are looking forward to staying connected en route, so we’ve made sure we’ll have free wi-fi throughout the train. <br><br>Behind the scenes, our internet connection will be delivered using 3G and 4G mobile networks. As such, connectivity will vary, but the good news is that most of the London-Paris route is covered. <br><br>To make sure our internet connection doesn’t get overloaded and slow down, we’ll have a fair use policy in place. This means:<br><br>1. We’ll block websites like Netflix or YouTube that use up a lot of data and bandwidth. <br>2. There’ll be download limits and once a customer reaches their data allowance, their connection speed will slow down. <br>3. Business Premier and Standard Premier travellers will have greater download limits than those in Standard coaches. <br><br>To help us continuously improve our wi-fi service, we’ll be proactively monitoring customer use and feedback and adjust our settings if we need to.<br></div>
