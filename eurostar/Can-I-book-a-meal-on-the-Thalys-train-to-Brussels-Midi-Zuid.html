    <h1>Can I book a meal on the Thalys train to Brussels-Midi/Zuid?</h1>
    <div><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Sorry, we can only guarantee you a meal if youâ€™re travelling in Standard Premier or Business Premier on board a Eurostar train between Brussels and London.<br>You can buy food on board some European trains. Otherwise there are lots of shops at our stations where you can pick up a snack or two to keep you going.</span></span></p></div>
