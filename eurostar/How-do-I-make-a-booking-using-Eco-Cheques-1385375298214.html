    <h1>How do I make a booking using Eco Cheques?</h1>
    <div>Eurostar is participating in the Eco Pass/Ecochèques scheme; however it is not possible to use these vouchers to purchase Eurostar tickets directly with us.

To exchange your Eco Pass/Ecochèques for Eurostar tickets please go to any of the Jetair centres in Belgium.

For more information on this please visit their web site at www.jetaircenter.be/agences.htm</div>
