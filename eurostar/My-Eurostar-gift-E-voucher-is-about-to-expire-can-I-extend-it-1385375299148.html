    <h1>My Eurostar gift E-voucher is about to expire can I extend it?</h1>
    <div>Eurostar E-vouchers are valid for one year from the day of purchase. This means you must make a booking within this year although the actual booking date can be beyond this year.

We are unable to extend e-voucher validity dates so please ensure you make a booking before the expiry date.</div>
