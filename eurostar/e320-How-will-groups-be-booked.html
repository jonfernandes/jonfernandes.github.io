    <h1>e320 - How will groups be booked?</h1>
    <div>Depending on capacity, if a very large group is booked on an e320 in Standard Premier, we may need to split the group between the two ends of the train. The configuration of the e300 is the same as the TMST, so Standard Premier is in the middle of the train. Group luggage will be handled in the same way but, on the e320, Eurodespatch will store the bags on the luggage racks in the coaches, as they do now on some of our trains.</div>
