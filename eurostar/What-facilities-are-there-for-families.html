    <h1>What facilities are there for families?</h1>
    <div>While there wonâ€™t be dedicated family areas on the e300 or the e320, both have been designed with the needs of families in mind. There are large pushchair-friendly luggage racks and baby changing facilities spread evenly throughout the train (six on the e300 and eight on the e320).</div>
