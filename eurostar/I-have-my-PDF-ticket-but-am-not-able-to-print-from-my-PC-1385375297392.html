Firstly open up your &#39;Print at home&#39; tickets so they are viewable on your screen.
1.     Click on &#39;file&#39; located at the top left of your screen.
2.     Go down the list and select &#39;Print&#39;.
3.     In the window that opens click on the advanced button located at the bottom of the window.
4.     Tick the box &#39;Print as image&#39; and then click on the ok button. Click ok again.
You should now be able to print your ticket.

If you are still unable to print your tickets, please go to the ticket desk at the station on departure where you will be able to obtain duplicate tickets.</div>
