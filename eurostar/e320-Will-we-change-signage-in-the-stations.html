    <h1>e320 - Will we change signage in the stations?</h1>
    <div>A new generic wayfinding sign has been developed that will replace the platform surface signage where it is now.<br>Digital screens in Lille and Paris will show travellers where their coach is.Â <br><br>These, along with our teams and much improved coach indicators on the trains themselves, will help travellers find their coach and seat quickly and easily.</div>
