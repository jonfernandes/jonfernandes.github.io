    <h1>e320 - What are priority seats?</h1>
    <div>The priority seats are a new addition to the e300 and e320 to conform with the current PRM regulations. Essentially they are extra legroom seats close to the doors which makes them suitable for elderly, pregnant or customers with limited mobility.<br><br>They’re not distinguished differently in the booking system and there is no difference in price. </div>
