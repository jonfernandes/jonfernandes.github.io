    <h1>Eurostar Safety</h1>
    <div>How safe is Eurostar? 
We treat passenger and staff safety and security as a number one priority. 
Eurostar is the only rail operator in the world to operate a passenger screening programme at all of its terminals. 
It is a requirement of the Channel Tunnel legislation. 


What safety measures do you have in place? 
We x-ray all luggage and security screen all passengers and their hand luggage. 
We also have measures in place that are not visible - we do not discuss these for obvious reasons. 
Eurostar works with the authorities in France, UK and Belgium to ensure its security measures meet their requirements. 
We also employ extra measures over and above what the authorities ask for. 


Have you increased security in your terminals and on your trains? 
We operate the highest security standards at all times. 
We can&#39;t comment on specific measures in place at any specific time.</div>
