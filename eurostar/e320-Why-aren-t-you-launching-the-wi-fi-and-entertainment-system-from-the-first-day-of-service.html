    <div><span style="font-size: 12px;">The wifi and entertainment system will be switched on gradually over the coming weeks.<br>Now that we are able to operate our new trains, we can do the final stage of live on route testing of the wifi with our passengers before it’s fully available on all e320s before Christmas.</span></div>
