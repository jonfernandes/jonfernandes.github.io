    <h1>European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)</h1>
    <div>It is recommended that UK residents travelling in Europe obtain a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). 

This will allow you to benefit from free or reduced-cost medical care when travelling in an EEA country or Switzerland.

The EHIC replaces the E111 and is free of charge.

For further information on the EHIC and on how to apply for one.

Please visit this web site. www.dh.gov.uk/travellers 

We would also recommend taking travel insurance in addition to the EHIC to ensure you are completely covered for every eventuality.
