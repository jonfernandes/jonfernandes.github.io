    <h1>Advice for photographers carrying film through the security scanners</h1>
    <div>Independent tests undertaken by the British Photographers&#39; Liaison Committee (BPLC), to establish the full and exact details of any potential film damage caused by baggage screening machines at stations and airports, have given the all clear to current hand luggage x-ray inspection systems installed at stations and airports.
Recommendations are that passengers should carry unprocessed film in their hand luggage. The findings confirm that hand luggage security scanning machinery is safe for all normal film types (up to and including ISO 400)*. Current digital camera storage media can also safely be examined by these x-ray machines without suffering ill effects.
Specialist film (ISO 800 and above) under exceptional circumstances, when passed more than eight times through the hand luggage security scanning machines, can be affected. However the nature of the change occurring is barely noticeable to the naked eye and indeed does not become clearly visible until film is exposed around 32 times.
Hand search requests for professional film will normally be accommodated, but the final decision in all individual cases will always rest with the on-duty security supervisor.
The results reported are in the context of standard film use. Professional photographers requiring more detailed information should refer in the first place to their own photographic association or organisation, or the BPLC on +44 (0)20 7739 6669.
*These films will be visually unaffected by up to eight and in some cases 32 passes through the hand luggage x-ray machines. Processed film can be x-rayed virtually without limit, without suffering any ill effects whatsoever from these machines.</div>
