    <div>No. Both GDS and BAF account bookings can be picked up at the station without a card being present. Alternatively, the tickets can also be printed online where possible using our Print at Home option. <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/manage-booking" target="_blank">Print your tickets online</a>Â </div>
