    <h1>How do I change the age bracket on a 'My Eurostar' account?</h1>
    <div>When you first set up a ‘My Eurostar’ account, you are asked which age group you fall within. 

This information is captured to help us better understand our client base and will not affect your being able to make bookings nor will it limit the type of tickets available to you. 

You can change this by logging onto your account and clicking on the preffered traveller link. You will then be able to modify the age details.</div>
