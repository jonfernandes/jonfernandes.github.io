    <h1>e320 - How will the onboard entertainment work? Is it free?</h1>
    <div>The e320 and e300 will have free onboard entertainment and there are plenty of brilliant features and content for our travellers to enjoy on their own devices. There’ll be top TV shows and movies, as well as games, weather and news updates, kids’ content and a moving map that shows their current location. <br><br>There are two ways to access our onboard wi-fi and entertainment:<br><br>1. Travellers without the Eurostar app can use the wi-fi network to access some entertainment at www.onboard.eurostar.com. This won’t give them the best experience, as it only provides limited access to all of the content available. That’s why we’ll be encouraging everyone to download and use the Eurostar app instead. <br><br>2. Travellers with the Eurostar app will have access to all of our great content on their own device, and enjoy a special selection of brilliant free entertainment, as well as news, weather and information about Eurostar. <br><br>It’s hugely important that we encourage all customers to download the Eurostar app before they board, so they can have the very best experience.</div>
