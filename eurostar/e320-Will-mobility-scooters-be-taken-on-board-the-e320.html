    <h1>e320 - Will mobility scooters be taken on board the e320?</h1>
    <div>Yes - Travellers need to book their mobility scooter through Eurodespatch. <br><br>Smaller mobility scooters (up to 70cm wide and 100cm long) will fit in our wheelchair spaces on the e320. <br><br>If the mobility scooter is bigger than 70 x 100 cm, Eurodespatch will advise if the larger mobility scooters can be accepted in the hold of an e300 or TMST.</div>
