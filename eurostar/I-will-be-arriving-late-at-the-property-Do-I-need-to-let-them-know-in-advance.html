    <div><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="">Our hotels will hold your booking until midnight on the day of your arrival.<br><br>After that time, they may cancel your booking as a no-show and make your room or rooms available to other guests. So it&#39;s very important that you let us know that youâ€™ll be late as soon as possible, so we can plan for your delay.</span></span></p></div>
