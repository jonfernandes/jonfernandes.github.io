    <h1>Customers returning from Disneyland Paris</h1>
    <div>The UK Border Agency is not able to carry out passport checks on departure from Marne-la-Vallée station (Disneyland® Paris).  Passports are checked on arrival in the UK.  As a result, customers should expect some queuing on arrival when returning from Marne-la-Vallée station.  Please bear this in mind if making any onward travel plans.</div>
