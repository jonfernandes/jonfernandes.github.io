    <h1>e320 - What will the seat maps look like on the booking system?</h1>
    <div>Seat maps on Elgar and Opera will show whether a service is an e320 or an e300/TMST, and the train type will be visible in the list of available trains on Elgar (TGT=TMST/e300, TGR = e320). Everything else on the booking system will stay the same. <br><br>For third party bookings, the e300 and e320 seat maps will be made available where the TMST maps are currently. <br><br>On eurostar.com or on our other distribution systems, travellers will see the seat map that corresponds to the train they’re travelling on. The seat map for the e300 and the TMST is exactly the same.</div>
