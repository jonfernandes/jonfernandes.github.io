    <h1>How do I book my taxi as a Eurostar carte blanche holder?</h1>
    <div>As a Eurostar carte blanche holder, you may pre-book a taxi for your arrival.
Where it&#39;s available
Pre-bookable taxis are available for arrivals at St Pancras International, Ebbsfleet International, Ashford International, Paris Gare du Nord and Brussels-Midi/Zuid.

How to book
Show your card in the Business Premier lounge (or at the information desk at Ashford International) and our staff will book you a taxi and give you a voucher. At arrivals (or at the drop-off area outside Ebbsfleet International) hand this voucher to the driver holding a card with your name.

How to pay
Pay the driver directly when you arrive at your final destination. Prices start from £25 in London and €50 in Brussels. In Paris payment is by the meter, with an extra charge of €10-15 to cover the call out and waiting time.</div>
