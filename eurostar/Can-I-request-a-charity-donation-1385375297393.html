    <h1>Can I request a charity donation?</h1>
    <div>Eurostar receives a large number of requests from charities or charitable events and cannot satisfy them all. Consequently, and in a spirit of fairness, we now organise a monthly draw to donate tickets.
If you wish to participate, please send an e-mail to charity@eurostar.com</div>
