    <h1>Eurostar carte blanche Membership</h1>
    <div>Eurostar carte blanche is the premier tier of Eurostar Frequent Traveller membership. 
To gain Eurostar carte blanche status you would need to earn the required number of points in a qualifying year.

Eurostar frequent traveller points are awarded in two ways:
- You can earn frequent traveller points from travelling on a qualifying ticket.
- You can earn frequent traveller bonus points, which are awarded at the discretion of Eurostar.

Only points earned from travelling on a qualifying ticket may be counted towards your tier status. You would need to earn 1,500 points in a qualifying year to gain carte blanche status.

By earning 1500 points on Eurostar travel in a membership year, you will be automatically upgraded to this level.

You are then entitled to valuable carte blanche extras including 10 minutes priority check-in and taxi service plus many other benefits designed to make your journey as effortless as possible.

All Eurostar carte blanche holders are entitled to lounge access, whatever ticket type purchased. You may take one guest with you during the week (Mon to Fri) and up to four guests at weekends (Sat and Sun).

* Lounge access entitlement is subject to available capacity and is at the discretion of lounge staff. 

You will automatically be sent a Eurostar carte blanche welcome pack once you have earned the required 1,500 points that entitle you to the upgrade. Your membership number will remain the same.

Please note:
An overall balance of 1500 points will not entitle you to Eurostar carte blanche if it is not made up of status points earned in the designated time period.</div>
