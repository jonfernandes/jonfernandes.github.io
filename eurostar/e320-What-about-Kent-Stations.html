    <h1>e320 - What about Kent Stations?</h1>
    <div>There are no restrictions for the e320 at Ebbsfleet and it’s already stopped there many times for testing. <br><br>At the moment, Ashford International does not have the right European signalling system to work with the e320. We’re currently working with Network Rail and the local council on a solution to make sure that Ashford remains a key part of our future.</div>
