    <h1>Is breakfast included as part of my hotel booking?</h1>
    <div>Most hotels do not automatically include breakfast. During the booking process some hotels will give the option of paying a extra to include breakfast.
If no mention of breakfast is shown during the booking process, please refer to the hotels information section. This will show if breakfast is available as a surcharge paid directly to the hotel when you check out.</div>
