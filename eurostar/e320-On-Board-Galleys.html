    <h1>e320 - On Board Galleys</h1>
    <div>The e320 will have food preparation galleys which are situated between coaches 1 and 2, and coaches 15 and 16. Customers will be able to walk through these galleys although, for obvious reasons, we would want to discourage this as much as possible !Â <br><br>We do know that in order to accommodate our BP passenger 10 minute check-in, some of our Business Premier customers will need to walk through the train and past the galley. The staff on board will therefore ensure that this is facilitated as and when necessary.</div>
