    <h1>Do mobile tickets expire? Do they remain in your phone?</h1>
    <div>Yes they do expire, but they stay visible in the mobile with less information. However weâ€™ve asked that for both Mobile tickets &amp; Passbook tickets, that the TCN be displayed even after travel. This should be ready before we go live,</div>
