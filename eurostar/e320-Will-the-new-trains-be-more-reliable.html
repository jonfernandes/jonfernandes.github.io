    <h1>e320 - Will the new trains be more reliable?</h1>
    <div>Absolutely. Siemens has built Velaro trains that are running reliably in Russia, Germany, Spain and China, so it’s a well-tested and successful model. We’re working closely with Siemens to make sure our e320s are four times more reliable than our TMSTs. <br><br>As for our e300s, TMSTs have become increasingly reliable since they were launched. Now that they’re being completely overhauled and fully refurbished, we expect them to give us many more years of reliable service. <br></div>
