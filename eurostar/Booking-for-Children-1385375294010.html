    <h1>Booking for Children</h1>
    <div>What age must a child be to qualify for a child fare?
Children between the ages of 4 and 11 years old inclusive qualify for a child fare.

A child under four years old does not need to be included on your booking and will not require a ticket to travel on the Eurostar. However, he or she will not be allocated a seat and will be required to sit on the lap of a parent or guardian. Please note that only one infant per adult traveller is allowed.

If you would like to book and pay for a seat for a child under 4 years old, please book a child fare. When you enter the passenger details you will need to put the child&#39;s age as over four years old otherwise the age will be rejected when proceeding to the next stage. This will not cause any issues relating to your travel.

Can my child travel alone? If so, what travel documents are required?
No child under 12 years of age can travel alone. Eurostar does not operate an Unaccompanied Minors Service and cannot guarantee that Minors will be accompanied to the train, nor will they be supervised at all times on board the train.

A competent person over 16 years old must accompany passengers under 12. Passenger&#39;s aged between 12 and 15 may travel alone provided they have a valid passport or identity card issued in their own name and are in possession of either a hand-written letter of consent from a parent or guardian, witnessed by an official person, or a completed Unaccompanied Minors Consent Form.

The completed Unaccompanied Minors Consent Form must be handed to a member of Eurostar staff at check in.

Any minor aged 12-15 inclusive must have in their possession throughout their journey the written consent of their parent or legal guardian.
What happens when travelling with children who aren’t my own?
If you are travelling with a child that is not your own – for example a family friend accompanying you on holiday – you are advised to carry with you a letter from the child’s parent or legal guardian together with a photocopy of the parent or guardian’s passport (photograph and details pages only) and a contact telephone number.

Please note: All passengers will need to be in possesion of a passport regardless of age.</div>
