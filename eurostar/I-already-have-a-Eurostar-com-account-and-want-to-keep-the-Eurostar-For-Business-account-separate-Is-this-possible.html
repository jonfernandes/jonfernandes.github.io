    <div><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="">Yes, you can create a separate Eurostar For Business account.Â  This is recommended if you want to keep your personal account separate from your business account. You must use a different company email address to the email you&#39;re using for your personal Eurostar.com account.</span></span></span></p></div>
