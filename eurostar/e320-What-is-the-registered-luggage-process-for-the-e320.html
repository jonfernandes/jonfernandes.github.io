    <h1>e320 - What is the registered luggage process for the e320?</h1>
    <div>With the exception of bikes, the registered luggage service will work as before and our internal processes work across our mixed fleet. As the e320 has no holds, we’ll store items in secure boxes on designated luggage racks in coaches 10 and 11. These are blocked for Eurodespatch use only. <br><br>For intermediate and seasonal stations (all except Lille) are still unable to accept registered items, so travellers will need to go to St Pancras, Gare du Nord, Brussels Midi or Lille.</div>
