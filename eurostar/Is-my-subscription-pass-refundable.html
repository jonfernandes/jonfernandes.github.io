    <h1>Is my subscription pass refundable?</h1>
    <div><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="">Changed your mind? At Eurostar, we understand.<br><br>Your subscription pass is refundable within 14 days of the purchase date.*<br><br>*This corresponds to the withdrawal period provided for by Directive 97/7/EC regarding the protection of consumers in relation to long term contracts. You are entitled to a full refund if your subscription has not been used. If you have already travelled with your subscription pass, Eurostar reserves the right to deduct - from the total price of your subscription - the difference between the price of the discounted fare and the price of the full fare.*</span></span></div>
