    <h1>Why do child National rail tickets and Eurostar tickets have different age restrictions?</h1>
    <div>National Rail child tickets are available for kids from 5 to 16 years old and children under 5 travel free. Anyone 16 years old or over is classified as an adult.
On Eurostar services, Child tickets are for 4 to 11 years olds and we also have Youth tickets for 12 to 25 year olds, so you can enjoy discounted tickets for longer. Little ones under 4* travel for free on Eurostar services and won&#39;t need a ticket.
Age groups are taken into account automatically by the booking system and your tickets will always be valid for the ages you tapped into the website. If you&#39;re travelling with children under 4 years old, you won&#39;t need to add them to your booking.
* Free travel for children up to the age of 4 is limited to 1 child per adult. Any additional children may need to buy a ticket.</div>
