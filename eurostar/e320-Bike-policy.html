    <h1>e320 - Why have you recently changed your new bike policy?</h1>
    <div><span style="font-size: 12px;">We are very constrained on space on our trains as passengers are increasingly bringing more and more registered luggage<br><br>When we changed our policy and asked passengers to put their bikes in a bag or box, we wanted to make it simple for customers, to protect the bikes and ultimately to be able to carry more bikes. <br>We understand however that this has concerned some passengers and we always listen carefully to feedback <br><br>After careful thought and planning we have taken the decision to continue to allow  fully mounted bikes on board but of course this can only be a small number because of the space constraints.</span></div>
