    <h1>How do I book my seat on a TGV, Thalys, ICE, SNCB or other Continental train?</h1>
    <div><b>Travelling on TGV, Thalys or TGV Lyria</b><br>You’ll find your seat and coach number on your ticket and confirmation email, along with your Eurostar seat details. <br><br>Unfortunately, we’re not able to choose where you sit or change your TGV, Thalys or TGV Lyria seat but feel free to speak to the train crew if you’d like to move once you’re on board.<br><br><b>Using an Any Belgian Station ticket</b><br>You’ll have a seat booked on Eurostar to Brussels-Midi/Zuid, but since you can hop on any train in the 24 hours after you arrive, there’s no need to reserve a seat. Just get on a train in Brussels and find a seat. If your Eurostar booking is in Standard Premier or Business Premier, you can sit in first class.</div>
