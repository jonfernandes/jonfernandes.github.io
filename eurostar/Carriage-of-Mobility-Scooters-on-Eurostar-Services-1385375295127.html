    <h1>Carriage of Mobility Scooters on Eurostar Services</h1>
    <div>Travellers who require mobility scooters to be taken with them during their journeys may carry them on board Eurostar without additional charge in the special luggage hold on our trains .

In order for the scooter to be able to access our platforms and trains via the lifts and ramps, it should not exceed 100cm (1 metre) in width.

To make sure that space is made available on busier services and during peak travel times such as Weekends, Bank Holidays and School Holidays, you should advise Eurostar in advance of your arrival using the Eurodespatch telephone number below.
