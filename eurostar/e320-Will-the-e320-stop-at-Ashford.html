    <h1>e320 - Will the e320 stop at Ashford?</h1>
    <div><span style="font-size: 12px;">Ashford International doesn’t currently have the right European signalling system to work with the e320. <br>We remain committed to Ashford as a key station on our route and have been working very closely with Network Rail and the local authorities in Kent over recent years to make sure we can access the station with our new trains as soon as possible. <br>In the meantime, our original trains will continue to serve the station. </span></div>
