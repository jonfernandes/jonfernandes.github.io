    <h1>Is there Wi-Fi access in the Eurostar Terminals and on board your trains?</h1>
    <div>The wireless network covers the whole of the departure area at St Pancras International, Paris Gare du Nord, Brussels Midi, the Business Quiet Area at the Ashford International and the departure lounge at Ebbsfleet International.

You can either purchase a voucher from our St Pancras International, Ebbsfleet International or Ashford International terminals, or pay online using a debit or credit card. In Paris and Brussels you can also purchase a voucher from the Relay shop or visit the SFR website in Paris and the Telenet website in Brussels for information on accessing Wi-Fi and prices.

Business Premier travellers and Eurostar carte blanche holders benefit from complimentary Wi-Fi access from the business lounges. Please ask a member of staff in the business lounges at London, Ebbsfleet, Paris and Brussels and at the information desk in the departure lounge at Ashford for more information.

Unfortunately, we are not currently able to offer Wi-Fi access on board our trains. However, this will be available in our refurbished trains coming into operation in 2013 and in our new fleet coming in 2014.</div>
