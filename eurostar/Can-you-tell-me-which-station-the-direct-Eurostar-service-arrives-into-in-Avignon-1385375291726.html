    <h1>Can you tell me which station the direct Eurostar service arrives into in Avignon?</h1>
    <div>If you are travelling in May and June 2013 using the Lyon Provence service the station the Eurostar will arrive to is Avignon TGV, outside Avignon city centre.

The direct Eurostar service to Avignon running from July to early September 2013 uses the Avignon city centre station.

If you are taking an indirect service with a connection via a TGV train, the trains will arrive into and depart from the Avignon TGV station.

A shuttle service links the two stations, for more information click here.</div>
