Do I need a passport or identity card to travel?
All passengers, including children and infants, are required to have a valid passport or (if a national of an EEA country) a valid national identity card for travel on Eurostar services. Some non-EEA nationals are also required to hold a valid visa. It is the passenger’s responsibility to ensure they have the correct documents before starting their journey. There is no guarantee that the authorities will permit passengers to travel if they do not hold the correct documents. Eurostar cannot offer advice regarding passport validity or visa requirements.

Do children need their own passports?
All children are required to be in possession or either a valid passport. (or national identity card for French and Belgium passengers)

My passport is in my maiden name. Will I still be able to travel?
Although this should not normally cause any difficulties, please take a copy of your marriage certificate with you when you travel.
My Passport only has a few months left on it. Will i still be able to travel?
As long as your passport is in date at the time you travel there is no requirement to have a minimum number of days left before it expires.
