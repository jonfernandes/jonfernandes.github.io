    <h1>e320 - Where are the wheelchair spaces and what else has changed for people with reduced mobility?</h1>
    <div>In all of our new trains, wheelchair spaces are in Standard Premier and Business Premier. On the e320, there are two spaces in coach 3 and an additional two in coach 14. There are also four spaces in the e300 in coaches 9 and 10. <br><br>For operational reasons, we’ll only sell two wheelchair spaces on each train for as long as we’re using TMSTs - one in each coach .<br><br>We’re also happy to say that 10% of the seats - known as &quot;priority seats&quot; - on our e320 and e300 have been designated as suitable for travellers with reduced mobility, and these include extra legroom for easier access. During the booking process, if a traveller identifies themselves as having reduced mobility, they can be offered one of these seats. Teams on board will also be able to reallocate these seats.</div>
