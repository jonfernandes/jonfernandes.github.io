    <h1>I am not able to make a booking on the direct Disney train</h1>
    <div>When booking a journey on the direct Disney train, please select the times as 09.00 for the outbound journey and 19.00 for the return journey.

You will then be offered fares on the direct Disney train.
The direct Disney service does not run every day outside of school holidays. 

If you want to travel outside of these times, there will be a connection with Eurostar in Lille where you will need to take a TGV train for the onward journey to Disney.</div>
