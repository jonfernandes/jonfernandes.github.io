    <h1>e320 - Why have we invested in a new fleet?</h1>
    <div>After ten consecutive years of growth, we’re seeing record demand for our services, as travellers increasingly choose us over the airlines. We’re also seeing much more demand for destinations beyond our core routes. <br><br>And that’s why we’ve invested so much time and money in our new fleet. <br><br>1. To increase capacity and meet an untapped demand on the London-Paris route. <br>2. To grow our business with the ability to travel to new destinations. <br>3. To deliver the best possible service to our travellers. <br><br>Our original order of ten new e320s is now well underway, and we’ve also announced our plans to buy seven more e320s. This increases our total number of new trains to 17 and an overall investment of over £1 billion in upgrading our fleet.</div>
