    <h1>What happens if EFT number is not transferred from GDS?</h1>
    <div>You will not get the points option. There’s no workaround. We actually want to push for eVouchers commercially speaking, even for loyalty members (we had the discussion with Dorothée). Compensation can only be claimed in points if the EFT number is on the ticket</div>
