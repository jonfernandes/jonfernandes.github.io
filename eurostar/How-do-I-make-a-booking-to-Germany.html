Some destinations may require a connection in Cologne and Frankfurt. Tickets are not valid on any other services</p>

<p>Whilst on Eurostar your seat is reserved, on Deutsche Bahn services you won’t need a reservation. Simply choose any seat that isn’t already reserved. Seats marked ggf.reserviert may be free, but can be booked at the last minute so you could be asked to change seats if someone has reserved it.</p>

<p>If you’re travelling in Standard Premier with Eurostar, you’ll be in First Class with DB where you’ll be able to order and pay for food and drinks at your seat. If you’re travelling Standard on Eurostar, you will be in Second Class with DB. All ICE trains include a Bordbistro with a selection of meals, drinks and snacks to buy.</p>

<p>In Germany the final destination of your train will be displayed on the screens under the column Ziel and the platform number will be under Gleis.<br><br>When travelling to the UK the final destination of all ICE services from Frankfurt,Cologne and Aachen is Brussels-Midi/Zuid. Trains also call at Brussels Nord, but don’t disembark here. Remember to leave at least 45 minutes to connect in Brussels-Midi/Zuid. This includes the 30 minute check-in time for Eurostar trains.</p></div>
