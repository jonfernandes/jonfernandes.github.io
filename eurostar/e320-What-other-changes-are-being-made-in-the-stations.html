    <h1>e320 - What other changes are being made in the stations?</h1>
    <div>The e320 is slightly longer than the TMST and e300 and the stopping point for all trains in our stations has been reviewed. We’re making a few changes at platform level, like moving some rain canopy pillars and security huts in Paris, before the e320s start running. <br><br>We launched our station capacity upgrade plan two years ago and it’s going really well. <br><br>We’re installing ePassport gates at St Pancras in late 2015 to increase the capacity at the French border control (PAF). This follows the installation of new security screening earlier this year.<br><br>The check-in area in Brussels-Midi is being expanded and will soon be able to handle 900 travellers per hour. ePassport gates will also be installed.<br><br>Paris Nord will see a 40% increase in capacity by late 2016. Check-in will be extended, ePassport gates will be installed, and the Business Premier lounge will be moved to create a bigger main lounge and a great new Business Premier lounge.</div>
