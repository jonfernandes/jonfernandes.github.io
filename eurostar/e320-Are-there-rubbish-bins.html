    <h1>e320 - Are there rubbish bins?</h1>
    <div>Yes, there are. We’ll have a number of larger rubbish bins underneath the glass partitions in each coach, making emptying them quicker and easier for our cleaning teams. <br><br>We’ve also introduced dedicated recycling bins in vestibules to help reduce the impact we have on the environment. </div>
