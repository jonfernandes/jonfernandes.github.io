    <h1>e320 - Why is there more content available when using the app?</h1>
    <div><span style="font-size: 12px;">There are certain rights associated with the use of content which we need to adhere to.<br>Making content available on the app means it protected from being copied or shared  onto other devices, and so  we can make more of it available.<br>The same content is also available when connecting via a laptop, as the rights management is built into the media player and added as a plug in to the browser.  <br><br><b>For our background:</b> Digital rights management (DRM) is a term referring to various access control technologies used to prevent premium content such as films and TV shows from being copied and shared on users’ devices. Early window films, studio content, Disney, the BBC, and other large media companies all require that their content is ‘DRM wrapped’. On laptops the DRM technology can be built into a media player and added as a plug in to the browser. For mobile devices it needs to be done via an app.</span></div>
