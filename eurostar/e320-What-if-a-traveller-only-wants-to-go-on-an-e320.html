    <div>We cannot, and should never, guarantee the type of train that a customer is travelling on. <br>The cost of the ticket is for the journey, not for a specific train type. <br>It is possible that some of our regular customers may work out which type of train they’re booked on from their seat and coach when they use the Manage my booking section at eurostar.com.</div>
