Can I use vouchers to pay for my tickets online? 
You can purchase your tickets either in full or in part on Eurostar.com using Eurostar eVouchers. Please enter the eVoucher code number(s) in the relevant box on the payment page.

Please note: 
Eurostar paper vouchers cannot be used for payment on the website. If you have paper vouchers, please phone our contact centre or they can be booked at the Eurostar ticket desk at St Pancras International, Ebbsfleet International or Ashford International.

If your vouchers have been issued as a result of a train delay or service disruption, you will need to make your booking at the Eurostar ticket desk at St Pancras International, Ebbsfleet International or Ashford International.
Please also note:
Paper vouchers and eVouchers can only be redeemed against Eurostar-only purchases i.e. they cannot be used to pay for bookings comprising of Eurostar + hotel and/or car hire.
Anyone can redeem the Gift voucher or E-voucher regardless of who made the purchase.</div>
