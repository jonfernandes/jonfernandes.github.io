    <h1>e320 - Will it cost more to travel on the new fleet?</h1>
    <div>No, it won’t. Travellers will buy tickets to their destination, as now, rather than for a specific train type, and there are no additional cost increases. We always try to keep our prices as competitive as possible and we’re not planning to increase prices because of our new fleet.</div>
