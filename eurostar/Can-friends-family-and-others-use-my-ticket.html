    <div><div><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif;">Tickets are designated to the name on the booking and canâ€™t be used by anyone else.<br><br>However, it&#39;s understandable people will want to join you on your travels, so you can of course book tickets for others. Just make sure names on the additional bookings match a valid travel document (for example, passport or ID card).<br><br>Do note, additional reservations made for others do not guarantee seats close to initial bookings, but with free <a href="https://help.eurostar.com/faq/rw-en/question/Is-there-wi-fi-at-the-station-or-on-the-train" target="_blank">wi-fi on all our trains</a>, you can keep in touch with them from different coaches or <a href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/travel-info/eurostar-experience/food-on-board" target="_blank">join them for a snack</a>.</span></span></div></div>
