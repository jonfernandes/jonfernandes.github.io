    <h1>Making a booking to Bruges</h1>
    <div>There are two ways to make a booking from London to Bruges depending on what type of train you want to travel on.

If you make a booking for &#39;Any Belgian Station&#39; your ticket will include onward travel to/from any Belgian station using the classic train service (not valid on Thalys or ICE). The onward journey is an open ticket and can be used on any train as long as the journey is made within 24 hours of arrival into Brussels. The return journey must be no more than 24 hours before your Eurostar journey.    

To find out information on train schedules please visit www.b-rail.be/main

If you wish to make a confirmed booking to Bruges you would need to book London to Brussels and then make a separate booking selecting from Brussels to Bruges using the drop down lists. This would give you a confirmed seat on a Thalys train.
Please note:
We now sell two types of tickets to Belgium. If you have a Brussels only ticket, you will not be able to travel further within Belgium without purchasing a separate ticket.</div>
