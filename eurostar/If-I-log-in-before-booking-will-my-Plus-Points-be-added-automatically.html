    <h1>If I log in before booking, will my Plus Points be added automatically?</h1>
    <div>Don’t forget, you can claim points on bookings even when you’re not travelling yourself. Just enter your Eurostar Plus Points membership number, or ask whoever’s booking to do so and we’ll add the points to your account.<br><br>It’s important that you enter your membership number when you book as we can’t add points afterwards.</div>
