    <h1>e320 - How will disruption be managed?</h1>
    <div>The e320 will be very reliable and we’ll only have to swap between train types in exceptional circumstances. These circumstances have been defined and agreed and they’ll be referred to as equipment changes. <br><br>Our reservations and check-in systems are being updated to handle a mixed fleet and it’s possible to move customers between equipment using these systems. <br><br>If a traveller is delayed because the equipment change means there’s no room for them on the train they booked, we’ll compensate them according to our normal compensation policy. <br><br>If necessary, we’ll also offer an incentive in stations for travellers to delay their journey if a last minute equipment change means there are more travellers than seats. We’ll define the value of this incentive before launch and our single-customer-view software at ECC will make sure the details of what was offered are captured.</div>
