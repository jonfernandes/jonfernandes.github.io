You can also indicate your preferred method to be contacted (email, phone or letter).<br><br>To help us resolve your complaint as quickly as possible, please include as much information as you can in your first message – for example, your booking reference and receipts for any expenses incurred – as this will help with our investigation.

We want to make every journey special and exceed your expectations, and to help us do so we collect customer feedback to enable us to improve.<br><br>Every year we survey around 120,000 travellers across all our routes, asking them to rate their satisfaction with a variety of aspects of their journey.<br><br>This data is used to give us a picture of what all our travellers think about key aspects of their Eurostar experience, such as booking, check-in, stations, lounges, food and the onboard environment.<br><br>The survey also includes key questions including how likely they are to recommend and use Eurostar again, and whether or not we offer value for money. The surveys are conducted via an online questionnaire, emailed to customers one working day after they have travelled.<br><br>The results are published monthly and presented to our senior management team. In any areas where satisfaction is low this team creates and implements plans to address them. The results are then revisited to ensure any actions have had the desired effect.<br><br>In addition we ensure data is collected by our contact centre and Traveller Care team to ensure we have a clear picture of the reasons for contact and volume of complaints received. Again, these are reported on and shared with our senior management team to address and inform future plans.<br><br>We also have both internal and external audits in place to track how well we deliver our commitments.</span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style=""><strong>CLAIMS FOR LOSSES, PROPERTY DAMAGE AND PERSONAL INJURY</strong><br>If you’d like to make a claim against Eurostar for losses, property damage or personal injury, this should be made by emailing or writing to our Traveller Care team.
