    <h1>How do I book my seat on the TGV, Thalys, ICE or other continental trains?</h1>
    <div>If your booking includes travel on a TGV, Thalys or TGV Lyria train, we’ll automatically reserve a seat for you when you book, and your seat number will be on your ticket and confirmation email.
We don’t have access to other train companies’ seating plans, which means any seating requirements will only be taken into account on the Eurostar part of your journey. If you’ve got particular requirements, just talk to the train crew when you check in for that part of your journey.
When you’re travelling in Belgium on InterCity or regional trains, you won’t need a reservation – just hop on and choose your seat.</div>
