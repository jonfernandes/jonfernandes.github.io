    <h1>Can someone else collect tickets booked with Eurostar frequent traveller?</h1>
    <div><p>Tickets must be collected by the credit card holder, at which time he or she will be asked to produce the relevant credit card and identification.<br><br>Please note that when making a booking less than 48 hours in advance of travel, you will only be given the option of collecting your tickets from the station on departure.</p>

<p>Reward tickets (i.e. those obtained using your EurostarÂ Frequent Traveller membership points) may be collected either by the member or by those named on the tickets - again, subject to the booking reference and some form of identification being produced at the time of collection.</p>
