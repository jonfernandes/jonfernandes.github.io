    <h1>e320 - How big will the fleet be eventually?</h1>
    <div>We currently have 27 trains in our fleet. <br><br>We initially bought ten e320 trains and we’re now buying an additional seven from Siemens. We also we plan to transform more of our TMSTs into e300s. <br><br>We’re always reviewing our fleet size but once the programme is complete, it’s likely our fleet will be of a similar size as today.</div>
