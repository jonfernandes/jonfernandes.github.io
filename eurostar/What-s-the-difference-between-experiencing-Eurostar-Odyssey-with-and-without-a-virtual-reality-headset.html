    <h1>What’s the difference between experiencing Eurostar Odyssey with and without a virtual reality headset?</h1>
    <div><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Since the virtual reality headset fills your visual field, this is the most immersive way of experiencing Eurostar Odyssey. It also adds a 3D effect so it feels like you can reach out and touch the fish.<br><br>It’s just as fun using just a phone or tablet, but you’ll only see the worlds in 2D.<br><br>However you dive into Eurostar Odyssey, you’ll experience a 360° view simply by looking up, down and all around from the comfort of your seat.</span></span></p></div>
