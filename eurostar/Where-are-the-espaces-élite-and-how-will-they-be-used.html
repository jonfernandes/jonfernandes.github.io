    <h1>Where are the espaces élite and how will they be used?</h1>
    <div>Our carte blanche élite travellers can use the espaces élite on all of our trains. This space is allocated by the Business Premier lounge team, who will contact the train manager to make sure the space is available. <br><br>The espaces élite on the new trains are in coaches 3 and 14 on the e320, and coaches 9 and 10 on an e300.</div>
