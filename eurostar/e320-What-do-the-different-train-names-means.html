    <h1>e320 - What do the different train names means?</h1>
    <div>As a train company, we find ourselves using all kinds of technical names and terms. Here’s a quick guide to the names of our original and newer trains. <br><br>TMST: Our original trains. This stands for Trans-Manche Super Train. <br><br>e300: Our freshly rebuilt TMST trains. They can reach 300km/h, hence the name. <br><br>e320: Our brand new trains from Siemens, which can reach a maximum speed of 320 km/h. You may also hear them referred to as Velaro, which is the family of Siemens trains that our e320 is based on.</div>
