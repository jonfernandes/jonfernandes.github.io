    <h1>Can I get assistance for a connecting UK train journey?</h1>
    <div><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="">If you&#39;re making a connection in the UK, just call either National Rail Enquiries (+44 (0)8457 48 49 50) or the individual train operator 24 hours before your journey. The system can book one-off journeys or a series of frequently made journeys. Once you&#39;re registered on the system, your details can be shared with other UK train companies.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="">If you&#39;re taking a taxi, most London black cabs have ramps, so they&#39;re accessible for wheelchair users.</span></span></p>
